"
Colorado,". Monophthongization of /aɪ/ and /aʊ/: Another feature of Colorado English is the monophthongization of the diphthongs /aɪ/ as in ""ride"" and /aʊ/ as in ""loud."" Instead of a glide from one vowel to another (/aɪ/ --> /aɪ̯/) or (/aʊ/ --> /aʊ̯/), these diphthongs are pronounced as simple, single vowels (e.g., /aɪ/ becomes /a:/, so ""ride"" sounds more like ""rad"").

"
Colorado,". Intervocalic /r/ deletion: In some varieties of Colorado English, particularly in the Denver area, the /r/ sound between vowels is often deleted. This means that words like ""car"" or ""tire"" might be pronounced as ""cah"" or ""tai"" respectively, without the /r/ sound. This feature is known as non-rhoticity."
Connecticut,""
Connecticut,". Rhoticity: Connecticut English is characterized by the pronunciation of the ""r"" sound in words ending in ""-r"" and in some other positions.
