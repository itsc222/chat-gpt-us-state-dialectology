"
Arkansas,". Voiced ""th"" substitution: In many dialects of Arkansas English, the voiced ""th"" sound, as in ""this"" and ""that,"" is replaced with either a ""d"" sound or an ""f"" sound. So, words like ""those"" and ""them"" may sound like ""doze"" and ""dem"" respectively.

Both words are pronounced with the same vowel sound, typically a lower back vowel similar to the ""ah"" sound in ""cot.""

"
Connecticut,". Nasalization of Vowels: Connecticut English also exhibits nasalization of vowels, particularly in certain contexts.

"
Connecticut,". Flat A: Connecticut English, like other New England dialects, often features a ""flat A"" sound. This refers to the pronunciation of the vowel in words like ""dance,"" ""bath,"" and ""ask"" with a distinct ""a"" sound that is flatter and farther back in the mouth compared to other English varieties. Therefore, ""dance"" might be pronounced more like ""dahns.""

"
Connecticut,". No Intervocalic R: In addition to r-dropping at the end of words, Connecticut English speakers might also drop the ""r"" sound between vowels, a phenomenon called ""no intervocalic R.""

"
Delaware,". Cultural Influences: Delaware English can also exhibit linguistic features influenced by the local culture. For example, the presence of a sizable African American community in Delaware has contributed to certain aspects of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) being incorporated into the local dialect.
