For instance, the coastal region may exhibit some unique lexical items or pronunciations influenced by Gullah, an African American English variety."
Hawaii,"1. Hawaiian Pidgin influence: One significant linguistic feature of Hawaii English is the influence of Hawaiian Pidgin. Pidgin is a creole language that developed in Hawaii during the plantation era when immigrants from various countries, such as China, Japan, the Philippines, and Portugal, worked on the sugar plantations. Many of these workers spoke different languages and developed a simplified, hybrid language to communicate, which eventually became known as Hawaiian Pidgin. Today, elements of Hawaiian Pidgin can be observed in the speech patterns, vocabulary, and grammar of many Hawaii English speakers."
Hawaii,"2. Vowel pronunciation: Hawaii English is known for its distinctive vowel pronunciation. The vowel sounds in words such as ""cat"" and ""caught"" are often merged, resulting in the use of a single vowel sound. This is known as the ""cot-caught"" merger, which is common in many American English dialects. However, in Hawaii English, the merged vowel sound is usually /ɑ/, so ""cot"" and ""caught"" would both be pronounced with an /ɑ/ sound."
Hawaii,"3. Glottal stops: Another prominent feature of Hawaii English is the use of glottal stops. A glottal stop is a sound made by closing the vocal cords momentarily, causing a brief break in sound. In Hawaii English, glottal stops are used in place of certain consonants, such as the ""t"" sound in words like ""water"" or ""bottle."" Instead of pronouncing the ""t,"" speakers may replace it with a glottal stop, resulting in pronunciations like ""wah-uh"" and ""boh-uhl."""
Hawaii,"4. Loanwords from Hawaiian: Hawaii English also incorporates numerous loanwords from the Hawaiian language. For example, words like ""aloha,"" ""mahalo,"" and ""lei"" have become widely used and recognized in English conversations in Hawaii. Additionally, some Hawaiian grammar and syntax patterns may influence sentence structure and word order in Hawaii English."
Hawaii,"5. Cultural references and code-switching: Hawaii English often reflects cultural references and code-switching between different languages and dialects.

Idaho,"3. Incomplete th-fronting: Unlike in some other American English dialects where the ""th"" sounds (as in ""think"" or ""bath"") can be pronounced as /f/ or /v/, in Idaho English, the th-fronting process is not fully realized. This means that the ""th"" sounds are generally pronounced as they appear in standard English."
Idaho,"4. Vowel raising: Idaho English also exhibits vowel raising, particularly with the vowel /ʌ/. This means that words like ""cut"" or ""but"" can be pronounced with a higher, more centralized vowel sound."
Idaho,"5. Pin-pen merger: Idaho English, like many other dialects in the Western United States, is characterized by the pin-pen merger. This merger results in the pronunciation of the words ""pin"" and ""pen,"" which are distinct in standard English, to be pronounced the same way, merging the two distinct vowel sounds."
Illinois,"1. The Phonological Shift: Illinois English features a phonological shift known as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. This shift involves changes in vowel sounds, such as pronouncing ""a"" as ""æ"" (for example, saying ""cat"" as ""cæt"") and ""o"" as ""ah"" (for example, saying ""cot"" as ""caht"")."
Illinois,"2. Flat A: Illinois English is known for the flat ""a"" sound, particularly in words like ""cot,"" ""lot,"" and ""dog."" Instead of the more rounded ""a"" sound found in other dialects, Illinois English speakers tend to use a flatter or more open sound."
Illinois,"3. Diphthongization of ""I"": In Illinois English, the vowel sound ""i"" often experiences diphthongization, which means it becomes a glide from one vowel to another within the same sound. For example, the word ""five"" may be pronounced as ""fahv"" or ""foy-v"" instead."
Illinois,"4. Rhoticity: Illinois English is generally rhotic, meaning that the ""r"" sound is pronounced at the end of words and before consonants, whereas some other dialects may elide or omit it."
Illinois,"5. Vocabulary and Expressions: Illinois English also has some distinctive vocabulary and expressions.

Regional phrases such as ""fixin' to"" (meaning ""about to"") and ""catty-corner"" (meaning diagonal) are also part of the unique linguistic landscape of the state."
Indiana,"4. Syntactic Features: Indiana English exhibits certain syntactic features within its dialect. One example is the double modal construction, which is expressed by using two modal auxiliary verbs together. For instance, ""I might could go to the store later"" or ""You should've ought to come with us."" This structure deviates from standard English, but it is commonly found in Indiana and other Midland regions."
Indiana,"5. Pin-pen Merger: The pin-pen merger is another linguistic feature of Indiana English. This merger occurs when the vowel sounds in the words ""pin"" and ""pen"" are pronounced in the same way, often as the vowel sound in ""pin."" So, both words could be pronounced like ""pin,"" without a distinction. This feature is more prevalent in the southern regions of Indiana."
Iowa,"1. Nasal vowels: One prominent feature of Iowa English is the nasalization of vowels. This means that vowels, particularly those before nasal consonants (e.g., 'm' or 'n'), are produced with air flowing through the nose as well as the mouth. This can result in characteristics such as the pronunciation of the word ""pen"" as ""pin"" or ""pin"" as ""pen."""
Iowa,"2. Midwestern accent: Iowa English reflects the broader Midwestern accent, characterized by a relatively flat intonation pattern and a lack of strong regional markers. While the accent may not stand out compared to other parts of the United States, it can be distinguished from accents found in other regions, such as the South or the Northeast."
Iowa,"3. Slight vowel shifts: Like other Midwestern accents, Iowa English exhibits some slight vowel shifts. For example, words such as ""cot,"" ""caught,"" and ""cawed"" might be pronounced with similar vowel sounds. This is often referred to as the ""cot-caught merger."""
Iowa,"4. T-glottalization: In Iowa English, the pronunciation of the /t/ sound can sometimes be realized as a glottal stop before a vowel sound. This means that words like ""better"" can be pronounced as ""be'er,"" with the /t/ sound replaced by a brief pause or closure of the vocal cords."
Iowa,"5. Vocabulary variations: While not strictly a linguistic feature, Iowa English also involves certain vocabulary variations that are regionally specific. For example, terms like ""pop"" instead of ""soda"" to refer to a carbonated beverage or ""barnyard"" to describe a rural area might be more commonly used in Iowa English compared to other dialects. These variations reflect the local culture and influence the overall linguistic context."

One such shift is the ""cot-caught merger,"" where the vowels in words like ""cot"" and ""caught"" are pronounced the same, typically as a low back vowel. Additionally, there is the ""pin-pen merger,"" where the vowels in words like ""pin"" and ""pen"" are also pronounced the same, usually as a front vowel."
Kansas,"3. Nasalization: Kansas English exhibits a high degree of nasalization, particularly in certain vowel sounds. This means that vowels are pronounced with air resonating in the nasal cavity, giving these vowels a distinct quality. For example, the vowel in words like ""cat"" or ""hat"" may be pronounced with additional nasal resonance."
Kansas,"4. Lexical variations: Like many regions, Kansas English has its own set of unique vocabulary and expressions. For instance, Kansans may use terms like ""crick"" instead of ""creek,"" or ""pop"" instead of ""soda."" Additionally, regional words for certain items or concepts may differ from standard English, reflecting local cultural terms or historical influences."
Kansas,"5. Speech rate: Kansas English is often characterized by a slower pace of speech compared to other regions. This slower speech rate may be attributed to various factors, including rural influences, cultural norms, or historical influences. However, it is important to note that this feature can vary among individuals and is not exclusive to Kansas."
Kentucky,"1. Southern Vowel Shift: Kentucky English is characterized by the Southern Vowel Shift, which involves changes in the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds.
