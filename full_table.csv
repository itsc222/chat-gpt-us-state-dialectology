These patterns are influenced by the grammatical structures found in other regional dialects, including Southern, Hispanic, and Native American English varieties."
Arkansas,"1. Southern Vowel Shift: Like other Southern dialects, Arkansas English exhibits the Southern Vowel Shift, characterised by changes in vowel sounds. For example, the pronunciation of words like ""ride"" and ""right"" may sound similar due to the merging of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aɪt/."

Colorado,"4. Monophthongization of /aɪ/: Colorado English displays a tendency to simplify the diphthong /aɪ/ to a monophthong. For instance, words like ""ride"" or ""eye"" may be pronounced with a longer /a/ sound, rather than a distinct glide between /a/ and /ɪ/."

Hawaii,"4. High Voice Onset Time: Another feature of Hawaii English is the pronunciation of consonants, particularly the voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/, with longer voice onset time (VOT).

Illinois,"4. Rhotic Pronunciation: Illinois English generally maintains a rhotic pronunciation, meaning that the /r/ sound is consistently pronounced after vowels, regardless of whether it is word-final or followed by a consonant."
Illinois,"5. Nasalization: Illinois English exhibits some degree of nasalization, particularly in the vowel sounds before nasal consonants such as /n/ and /m/. This means that the vowels in words like ""man"" or ""pan"" may sound slightly more nasalized compared to other dialects."
Indiana,"1. The Hoosier Vowel Shift: Indiana English is known for its distinctive vowel pronunciation, especially in the northern parts of the state.
