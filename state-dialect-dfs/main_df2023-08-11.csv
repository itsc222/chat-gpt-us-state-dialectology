These patterns are influenced by the grammatical structures found in other regional dialects, including Southern, Hispanic, and Native American English varieties."
Arkansas,"1. Southern Vowel Shift: Like other Southern dialects, Arkansas English exhibits the Southern Vowel Shift, characterised by changes in vowel sounds. For example, the pronunciation of words like ""ride"" and ""right"" may sound similar due to the merging of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aɪt/."

Colorado,"4. Monophthongization of /aɪ/: Colorado English displays a tendency to simplify the diphthong /aɪ/ to a monophthong. For instance, words like ""ride"" or ""eye"" may be pronounced with a longer /a/ sound, rather than a distinct glide between /a/ and /ɪ/."

Hawaii,"4. High Voice Onset Time: Another feature of Hawaii English is the pronunciation of consonants, particularly the voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/, with longer voice onset time (VOT).
