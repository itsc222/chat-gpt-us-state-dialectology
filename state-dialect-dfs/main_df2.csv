This usage of ""like"" has become emblematic of California English and is associated with a laid-back and informal speaking style."
California,"5. Intonation Patterns: Californians frequently use a rising intonation pattern at the end of statements, leading statements to sound more like questions. This is known as the ""California Question Intonation"" or ""Valley Girl Intonation,"" and it is often associated with the stereotypical way of speaking associated with Californians, particularly in the southern part of the state."
Colorado,"1. Coalescence of vowels: In Colorado English, there is a tendency to merge or coalesce certain vowel sounds.

Coloradans may use terms such as ""fourteener"" to refer to mountains exceeding 14,000 feet in elevation, ""skookum"" for something impressive or outstanding, or ""high country"" to describe the mountainous regions of the state. These regionalisms contribute to the distinct linguistic identity of Colorado English."
