Today, elements of Hawaiian Pidgin can be observed in the speech patterns, vocabulary, and grammar of many Hawaii English speakers."
Hawaii,"2. Vowel pronunciation: Hawaii English is known for its distinctive vowel pronunciation. The vowel sounds in words such as ""cat"" and ""caught"" are often merged, resulting in the use of a single vowel sound. This is known as the ""cot-caught"" merger, which is common in many American English dialects. However, in Hawaii English, the merged vowel sound is usually /ɑ/, so ""cot"" and ""caught"" would both be pronounced with an /ɑ/ sound."
Hawaii,"3. Glottal stops: Another prominent feature of Hawaii English is the use of glottal stops. A glottal stop is a sound made by closing the vocal cords momentarily, causing a brief break in sound. In Hawaii English, glottal stops are used in place of certain consonants, such as the ""t"" sound in words like ""water"" or ""bottle."" Instead of pronouncing the ""t,"" speakers may replace it with a glottal stop, resulting in pronunciations like ""wah-uh"" and ""boh-uhl."""

Idaho,"3. Incomplete th-fronting: Unlike in some other American English dialects where the ""th"" sounds (as in ""think"" or ""bath"") can be pronounced as /f/ or /v/, in Idaho English, the th-fronting process is not fully realized. This means that the ""th"" sounds are generally pronounced as they appear in standard English."
Idaho,"4. Vowel raising: Idaho English also exhibits vowel raising, particularly with the vowel /ʌ/. This means that words like ""cut"" or ""but"" can be pronounced with a higher, more centralized vowel sound."
Idaho,"5. Pin-pen merger: Idaho English, like many other dialects in the Western United States, is characterized by the pin-pen merger. This merger results in the pronunciation of the words ""pin"" and ""pen,"" which are distinct in standard English, to be pronounced the same way, merging the two distinct vowel sounds."

This structure deviates from standard English, but it is commonly found in Indiana and other Midland regions."
Indiana,"5. Pin-pen Merger: The pin-pen merger is another linguistic feature of Indiana English. This merger occurs when the vowel sounds in the words ""pin"" and ""pen"" are pronounced in the same way, often as the vowel sound in ""pin."" So, both words could be pronounced like ""pin,"" without a distinction. This feature is more prevalent in the southern regions of Indiana."
Iowa,"1. Nasal vowels: One prominent feature of Iowa English is the nasalization of vowels. This means that vowels, particularly those before nasal consonants (e.g., 'm' or 'n'), are produced with air flowing through the nose as well as the mouth.

One such shift is the ""cot-caught merger,"" where the vowels in words like ""cot"" and ""caught"" are pronounced the same, typically as a low back vowel. Additionally, there is the ""pin-pen merger,"" where the vowels in words like ""pin"" and ""pen"" are also pronounced the same, usually as a front vowel."
Kansas,"3. Nasalization: Kansas English exhibits a high degree of nasalization, particularly in certain vowel sounds. This means that vowels are pronounced with air resonating in the nasal cavity, giving these vowels a distinct quality. For example, the vowel in words like ""cat"" or ""hat"" may be pronounced with additional nasal resonance."
Kansas,"4. Lexical variations: Like many regions, Kansas English has its own set of unique vocabulary and expressions. For instance, Kansans may use terms like ""crick"" instead of ""creek,"" or ""pop"" instead of ""soda."" Additionally, regional words for certain items or concepts may differ from standard English, reflecting local cultural terms or historical influences."
Kansas,"5. Speech rate: Kansas English is often characterized by a slower pace of speech compared to other regions.
